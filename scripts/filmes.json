The series is animated in Ireland by Brown Bag Films but uses British voice actors. The TV series is based on American-Canadian children's books written by Vicki Wong and Michael C. Murphy of Meomi Design Inc.\n\nThe Octonauts follows an underwater exploring crew made up of stylized anthropomorphic animals, a team of eight adventurers who live in an undersea base, the Octopod, from where they go on undersea adventures with the help of a fleet of aquatic vehicles.\n\nThe subject matter is reminiscent of Star Trek and Thunderbirds blended with Jacques Cousteau. Although it is science fiction as regards its technology, the exotic creatures and locations that the crew encounter are real marine animals in their natural habitats.",

Two series have been produced, each consisting of 52 seven-minute episodes. English actor and comedian Stephen Fry narrates the English-language version and José María del Río narrates the Castilian Spanish version.\n\nSet in a 3D space, with a plain white background and usually no backdrops, it is about Pocoyo, a 3-year-old boy, interacting with his friends Pato, Elly and Loula. Viewers are encouraged to recognise situations that Pocoyo is in, and things that are going on with or around him. The narrator usually speaks explicitly to the viewers and to the characters as well. Each character has its own distinctive dance and also a specific sound, and most episodes end with the characters dancing. Many episodes also involve parties.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it was originally broadcast on CITV, a children's strand on the ITV network. In September 2007, Channel 5 acquired terrestrial rights in the United Kingdom to the first and second series, making it part of the Milkshake! strand. The show, however, will continue to air on the CITV Channel. Other broadcasters in the English speaking countries include RTÉ in the Republic of Ireland, Nick Jr. in the U.S. nationwide and local station KCET-TV as well as KLCS-TV channel 58-2 in Los Angeles and on Univision in LATAM Spanish, Treehouse TV in Canada, ABC in Australia and TVNZ in New Zealand.",

The series was created by, and is written by Jane Turner and Gina Riley who play the title characters: a suburban mother and daughter with a dysfunctional relationship. The series main characters consist of Kath Day-Knight, a cheerful 50-year-old woman, her self-indulgent daughter Kim Craig, Kath's boyfriend and second husband, the metrosexual Kel Knight, as well as Kim's estranged husband Brett Craig and her lonely, overweight \"second best friend\" Sharon Strzelecki. The series is set in the fictional suburb of Fountain Lakes in Melbourne. It is primarily filmed in Patterson Lakes.\n\nThe series was conceived by Turner and Riley in the early 1990s as a weekly segment of the Australian comedy series Fast Forward. The skit was then developed into a full-series. The first series of Kath & Kim premiered on ABC TV on 16 May 2002, with three further series following, while a television movie, entitled Da Kath and Kim Code, was broadcast nationally on 25 November 2005. Kath & Kim has garnered much critical acclaim since its debut, winning two Logie Awards, for \"Outstanding Comedy Programme\" and the \"Best Television Drama Series\" award at the Australian Film Institute Awards. In Australia, it has become a pop culture phenomenon, and is a success with audiences nationwide. Internationally, the series has spawned a cult fanbase, and in 2006 it was announced an American version of the series would be produced, to air on NBC. Riley and Turner served as executive producers on the US version. The American version was also picked up by Seven, which debuted the program on 12 October 2008, just three days after its debut in the United States.",

The series is set in San Francisco.\n\nIt was the second-most-watched show on UPN's Monday night line-up and fourth overall on the network. The show was on The CW's first draft line-up in March 2006, but due to several circumstances—including The CW's contractual obligation to pick up Reba, the uncancelling of All of Us, and the pick-up of the Girlfriends spin-off The Game—Half & Half was left off the final Fall 2006 schedule and ended production. The series has aired in reruns on Global TV in Canada, Trouble in the UK and in local syndication in the United States. It also airs in the United States on TV One.",

This drama serial consists of 30 episodes, and was screened on every weekday night at 9:00 pm.\n\nBeing the mid-year Channel 8 blockbuster of 2009, it was the first Channel 8 drama to be fully filmed in HD.\n\nDespite being touted as the 2009 blockbuster of the year and featuring many established actors and actresses like Zoe Tay, Li Nanxing and Fann Wong, the show's reception was lukewarm at best. Many viewers faulted the serial for improbable casting and for a lack of originality in certain parts of the scripting. The series also came under harsh criticism for being overly melodramatic. However, the performance of newcomers such as Jerry Yeo, who played an antagonist for the first time, were widely praised.",

As a consequence, they were stripped of their god-given protection called \"Ena\" which allowed them to breathe underwater. Over time, the rift between the denizens of the sea and of the surface widened, although contact between the two peoples still existed.\n\nThis show follows the story of Hikari Sakishima and Manaka Mukaido, along with their childhood friends Chisaki Hiradaira and Kaname Isaki, who are forced to leave the sea and attend a school on the surface. There, the group also meets Tsumugu Kihara, a fellow student and fisherman who loves the sea.\n\nHikari and his friends' lives are bound to change as they have to deal with the deep-seated hatred and discrimination between the people of sea and of the surface, the storms in their personal lives, as well as an impending tempest which may spell doom for all who dwell on the surface.",

A nearly decade-long romance with the infamous Dr. Dre pushed her into a life tarnished by alcohol, drugs and violence until her savior came in the unlikely form of Suge Knight, co-founder of Death Row Records and Dre's business partner. Friendship would turn into a courtly romance, but the union Michel'le thought they had did not end happily ever after. With children from both men and a career to protect, Michel'le's voice became silenced by Compton's biggest power players. Until now.",

Since she was in preschool, Shia has worked as a model and then a teen actress before becoming an idol. Her fraternal twin sister, Shi Yeon, is almost double the body size of Shi Ah and has always been ridiculed and bullied in school for her large frame. Because of this, Shi Yeon has become a recluse, who prefers staying home and producing an Internet broadcast within the safety of her room. The only time Shi Yeon ventures out is to visit a mysterious tarot card reader who gives Shi Yeon a magical tarot card every day. But the twin sisters’ lives are turned upside down when they wake up one day and realize that their souls have switched bodies! What will an idol musician and Shi Yeon’s high school crush think of the women they thought they knew?",

They observe a world which magecraft couldn't observe and science couldn't measure all to prevent the certain extinction of humanity.  But one day, the future that Chaldea continued to observe disappears and humanity's extinction in 2017 becomes clear. Rather, it had already happened.  The cause seems to be related to Fuyuki, a provincial town in Japan, in the year 2004 CE. There, an \"unobservable region\" that had not existed before appears.  Based on the assumption that Fuyuki is the reason for humanity's extinction, Chaldea issues an order to explore, investigate, and possibly destroy this singularity – a quest for the Holy Grail, the Grand Order.",

Now humanity has lost access to the city's controls, and is hunted down and purged by the defense system known as the Safeguard. In a tiny corner of the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and dwindling food supplies. A girl named Zuru goes on a journey to find food for her village, only to inadvertently cause doom when an observation tower senses her and summons a Safeguard pack to eliminate the threat. With her companions dead and all escape routes blocked, the only thing that can save her now is the sudden arrival of Killy the Wanderer, on his quest for the Net Terminal Genes, the key to restoring order to the world.",

What emerges is a deeply human trip to the foundations of discovery and a powerful reminder that the unanswered questions are the most crucial ones to pose.  Directed by Emmy-nominated and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Ian Cheney and advised by world-renowned filmmaker Werner Herzog, The Most Unknown is an ambitious look at a side of science never before shown on screen.",

Inspector Amaia Salazar leads the investigation, taking her back to the heart of the Basque country where she was born, and where she hoped never to return. Shrouded in mist and surrounded by impenetrable forests, it is a place of unresolved conflicts and a terrible secret from Amaia’s childhood that will come back to haunt her.  Faced with the superstitions of the village, Amaia must fight the demons of her past to confront the reality of a serial killer on the loose. But as she is drawn deeper into the investigation, she feels the presence of something darker lurking in the shadows…",

There’s no time to think about the people he left behind in the village.  Until silence cuts through the city racket with three words: mother has died. With those words Mashoto’s life changes forever. He returns home, to the place he abandoned, to bury his only ally.  Yet his mother has left behind a gift. Her voice, her unseen presence, a gentle whisper urging him to open his eyes and strain his ears- to learn the lessons of nature, of the earth and the roots that draw their nourishment from it.  Cast out by his father after losing the little money his mother had left, Mashoto must learn to survive from the land. He must learn to face old enemies and forge new alliances, to fight and to love. Most of all, Mashoto must discover what it is he is fighting for.",

But in an unexpected turn of events, Isoken meets Kevin and falls in love with him, and he just might be what she truly wants in a partner. The only problem: not only is he not an Edo man--he is Oyinbo (Caucasian).

The film reveals the extraordinary life of the charismatic Abdus Salam, in all its color, vitality and tragedy. It is the story of a man who traversed two worlds with ease: one of science and religion, modernity and tradition, war and peace and obscurity and celebrity. When he won the Nobel prize in 1979, he became the very first Pakistani to achieve this distinction, and only the fourth from the subcontinent. Born in 1926 in a remote village in Punjab, British India, Salam was a child prodigy. He came from humble beginnings, growing up in a small brick house with a large family of eleven. While Salam's legacy looms large in the world of physics, he is largely forgotten in Pakistan because of his faith. Children do not read about him and he is still vilified and maligned by right wing clerics for being a \"Qadiani\"-a derogatory term for someone belonging to the Ahmadiyya community. By telling this complex story of a man who due to extremism could not strengthen his people as he so deeply desired, the film draws attention to the state of affairs in the world today, where knowledge is sacrificed at the altar of ignorance and intolerance, depriving the coming generation of all that is precious.",

Although they are required to take tests daily, the children are free to spend their time as they see fit, usually playing outside, as long as they do not venture too far from the orphanage — a rule they are expected to follow no matter what. However, all good times must come to an end, as every few months, a child is adopted and sent to live with their new family... never to be heard from again.\n\nHowever, the three oldest siblings have their suspicions about what is actually happening at the orphanage, and they are about to discover the cruel fate that awaits the children living at Grace Field, including the twisted nature of their beloved Mama.",

The job is simple enough; there is a stack of forty-two million dollars hidden away in an apartment owned by an unknown politician. If Bem can move the money, he can keep it but for a large chunk that goes to his contact as finder's fee. But when the dangerous man he duped earlier threatens his life, he decides to give it a shot. He reunites with his former partner, Jerome, who left the game after marriage and they both start to plan what could possibly be the greatest heist the country has ever witnessed. After several impossible suggestions, Bem and Jerome come up with a dicey plan. They start to navigate the several problems they could encounter and what was supposed to be a two man job turned to a six man job with every single one of them having an ulterior motive of being on the job.",

Or so she thinks - Until she accidentally finds out that the man she was busy planning her forever with, had been planning his forever with someone else. After a messy breakup with Lunga, her commitment-phobic bestie, Noni, helps Dineo face what she dreads most: life as a single woman. Forced to move out of Lunga's apartment, Dineo seeks refuge with Noni. But letting go of another failed relationship is hard for Dineo. Now at her lowest point, Noni encourages Dineo to enjoy the spoils of singledom. Have fun. Meet new people. Become her own person. It's an intimidating notion for Dineo. She hasn't been single in years. But Noni is happy to be her guide. Together, they take the city night life by storm. But love is a difficult thing to avoid: Noni unexpectedly finds herself falling for an unlikely man and Dineo struggles to sidestep the traps of her romantic flaws. This is further complicated when Lunga realises the mistake he's made and declares his undying love to Dineo, wanting her back. Is Dineo strong enough to honour the new version of herself or will her fear of loneliness have her running back into Lunga's arms?",

Set in 2006, the film explores the results of Arab and Muslim Americans being increasingly detained for \"guilt by association\". The film links the civil rights struggle of Arab/Muslim Americans with that of African Americans through Marjoun's attendance of Central High School. It weaves her story into the lineage of the Little Rock Nine. This film is set also at Magnolia Grove Monastery in Mississippi. This Zen Buddhist monastery has been established in the tradition of the friendship of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, bringing together the themes of civil rights movements and interfaith practice. This is an expansion of the short film by the same title, that was an official selection of the Sundance Film Festival.",

But leaders struggled with a secret: their own “same-sex attractions” never went away.

Focusing on the dramatic journeys of former conversion therapy leaders, current members, and a survivor, PRAY AWAY chronicles the “ex gay\" movement’s rise to power, persistent influence, and the profound harm it causes.",

    "description": "The story of Dirty Lines starts in 1987's Amsterdam, at a time when Dutch society was changing rapidly. Psychology student Marly Salomon takes on a side job working for a brand new firm: Teledutch - a company started by two brothers, Frank and Ramon Stigter, who established Europe’s first erotic telephone lines. Frank and Ramon become rich overnight and Marly finds herself immersed in this wild and rapid transformation. The final years of the Cold War sparked a sense of hope and inspired a new generation to celebrate life to its fullest. Amsterdam became the center of that cultural revolution with a radically new form of music: house and a new love drug: XTC. The erotic phone lines offer the opportunity to experience anonymous sex in a new way, changing the morality of its consumers, but also very much the people creating it.",

Even a tender love bond develops between Impi and the blond daughter Elizabeth. But they have to be on their guard when neighboring farmers come to visit. When three racist upstart Boers arrive on the farm one day, tragic incidents occur with terrible consequences. The two Zulu boys are now on their own. Several years after surviving this childhood tragedy, the now grown brothers each find themselves on the opposing sides of the law. One is a gangster, the other is a police officer. A heinous gang crime tests their loyalty to one another.",

Each writer was asked to visualize the future and write a story, something rather personal. As Yaraqa read through their reflections, it reached out to a select group of professional dancers and asked them to respond to the text they'd received with movement and dance. In their personal spaces, every dancer embodied the text and filmed their work with a mobile phone. Yaraqa then took the text and footage, pieced them together, curated narration and music to create 8 home-based short films around one central theme. The episodes depict a range of emotions and gently remind us that in times of extreme uncertainty a basic human need emerges, that of re-imagining the future.",
